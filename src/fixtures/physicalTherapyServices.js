    title: "CUPPING",
    description:
      "Cupping is a type of alternative therapy that originated in China. It involves placing cups on the skin to create suction which increases blood circulation to the area where the cups are placed. This can relieve muscle tension and improve overall blood flow and promote cell repair. It can also help form new connective tissues and create new blood vessels in the tissue.",

    title: "DRY NEEDLING",
    description:
      "The aim of Trigger Point Dry Needling is to reduce muscle pain and dysfunction by releasing oversensitive areas in the muscle known as myofascial trigger points. Trigger points can be a source of pain and can commonly refer pain to different areas. Trigger points can develop as a result of overloading a muscle, overuse, or when the body is in a stressed and tense state. When the needle is inserted into the trigger point, the muscle will undergo a localised contraction known as a ‘twitch’. You may also feel a deep aching in the muscle, both of which are normal reactions and will result in therapeutic benefit from the technique.",
